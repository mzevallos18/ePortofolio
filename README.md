# Course Planner with AVL Tree Optimization

## Overview
This project was originally developed for the **CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms** course and later enhanced for my **CS-499 ePortfolio**.  
It was rebuilt from its original **C++ Binary Search Tree** version into a fully reconstructed **Python program** that integrates an **AVL Tree** for self-balancing, ensuring faster and more efficient course lookups and insertions.  
The enhancement focused on improving efficiency, maintainability, and scalability while showcasing practical applications of algorithmic and data-structure principles.

## Key Features
- **Self-Balancing AVL Tree:** Automatically maintains balance during insertions to guarantee optimal search, insert, and traversal performance.  
- **CourseStore Class:** Synchronizes data across multiple views (list, dictionary, and tree) for flexibility and consistency.  
- **Enhanced Search and Traversal:** Allows ordered retrieval and efficient querying of course information.  
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Handles invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring robust and stable execution.  
- **Readable and Modular Code Structure:** Clean separation of logic improves maintainability and readability.
