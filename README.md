# Professional Self Assessment

## Overview
This ePortfolio represents the completion of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. It showcases my technical growth, problem solving ability, and readiness to enter the professional software development and data engineering fields. The portfolio demonstrates my capability to design, build, and secure software solutions across multiple domains including mobile application development, algorithm design, and database management.

Through the creation and enhancement of my three major artifacts, I applied the key principles of the Computer Science program outcomes which include collaboration, communication, algorithmic design, technical implementation, and security. Each project in this portfolio highlights a different area of technical specialization while together forming a complete picture of my professional readiness.

## Artifact 1: Android Inventory App  
**Course:** CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming  
**Category:** Software Design and Engineering  

This artifact demonstrates secure software design and mobile development skills. The app allows users to manage inventory data through a simple and secure interface.  
Enhancements included:
- Secure login and logout features.  
- Role based access control for Admin and User roles.  
- Session handling for persistent logins.  
- Data persistence through local storage helpers.  
- Improved usability with plus and minus buttons for quantity updates.

These changes transformed the app from a classroom prototype into a realistic mobile inventory management tool that balances usability and security. It highlights skills in Android Studio, Java programming, UI and UX design, and secure session management.

## Artifact 2: Course Planner with AVL Tree  
**Course:** CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Category:** Algorithms and Data Structures  

This project began as a simple C++ binary search tree and was enhanced into a Python based program implementing a self balancing AVL tree. The updated version improves data retrieval performance and ensures consistent ordering of course data.  
Enhancements included:
- Conversion from C++ to Python for modularity and readability.  
- Implementation of AVL tree rotations for self balancing.  
- CourseStore class for synchronization between array, dictionary, and tree views.  
- Error handling and validation for consistent data integrity.  

This artifact demonstrates algorithmic thinking, complexity optimization, and performance evaluation which are key competencies in computer science and data engineering.

## Artifact 3: Animal Shelter CRUD Dashboard  
**Course:** CS340 Client Server Development  
**Category:** Databases  

This artifact showcases full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in a database environment. It was reconstructed into a standalone Python application that integrates MongoDB for storage and Dash for visualization.  
Enhancements included:
- Rebuilding the full CRUD system to restore complete functionality.  
- Implementing MongoDB indexing and optimized queries for faster retrieval.  
- Designing a Dash based dashboard for dynamic data filtering and visualization.  
- Adding a data seeding script to populate records for realistic testing.  
- Secure handling of database updates and deletions to maintain data integrity.  

This project demonstrates backend development, data visualization, and database management. It also emphasizes the ability to deliver user friendly analytical tools that bridge technical data and practical decision making.

## Integrated Skills Across Artifacts

Each artifact reflects core competencies from the Computer Science program:

- Software Development: Full project lifecycles from planning to testing.  
- Algorithms and Data Structures: Implementation of balanced trees and efficient lookups.  
- Databases: CRUD operations, schema management, and visualization.  
- Security: Authentication, authorization, and safe data handling.  
- Communication: Documentation and structured explanations for technical and non technical audiences.  

These projects complement each other.  
The Android app demonstrates secure front end design, the Course Planner represents computational and algorithmic problem solving, and the CRUD Dashboard ties those concepts together through backend and database systems.

## Professional Reflection

Completing the ePortfolio strengthened both my technical and professional identity. It taught me to plan projects strategically, evaluate trade offs, and design software that is maintainable and secure. The process improved my ability to think critically, debug systematically, and align each design decision with performance, scalability, and user experience.

I also learned the importance of clear communication through writing documentation and READMEs that other developers can follow easily. These skills are crucial in team environments where maintainability and clarity directly affect productivity.

---

## Future Outlook

While each project meets the course expectations, they also serve as foundations for future growth. The Android app can be extended with a cloud backend, the AVL tree project can evolve into a full scheduling system, and the CRUD Dashboard could connect to real world datasets for analytics. These enhancements reflect my continued interest in combining data engineering, software development, and secure system design in future roles.

## Conclusion

This portfolio demonstrates the combination of everything I have learned throughout the Computer Science program. By completing and enhancing these artifacts, I proved my ability to develop software that is secure, efficient, and user centered. I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained through this program have prepared me to contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science and adapt to the ever changing technology landscape.
